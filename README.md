# stout_vs_porter
A machine learning approach to explaining the differences between the beer styles of stout and porter based on their recipes, using logistic regression and a decision tree as tools to classify recipes/beers as stouts or porters.

Obviously, this is a very small data set and it stands to reason that these models are likely overfit to the small samples, especially without cross validation. However, this MVP seems to imply that the features of medium kilned crystal, flaked adjuncts, and roasted barley give some indication as to some of the possible differences between stouts and porters.
